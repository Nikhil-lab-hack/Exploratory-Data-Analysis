# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Welcome to this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a sales dataset comprising 255 rows and 10 columns. Utilizing Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and Streamlit, this analysis offers a structured approach to data cleaning, trend exploration, and interactive visualization—delivering actionable business insights for effective decision-making.
To ensure you can successfully run and interact with the files in this repository, please follow the steps below:

**Instructions:**

- Open the project folder and files using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for an optimal coding experience and easier management of scripts.
- Before executing the analysis, install all necessary Python libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
  ```
  pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib streamlit
  ```
- These libraries are required for data processing, visualization, and creating the interactive dashboard. Without them, the code will not execute properly.
- After setting up VS Code and installing the libraries, you’ll be able to run the Python scripts and explore the dashboard locally on your machine.

**Note:**  
If you encounter any library-related errors, double-check the installation or refer to official documentation for help. Following these steps will ensure the analysis works smoothly and all features are accessible.
